It is used in web development, data science, creating software prototypes, and so on. Fortunately for beginners, Python has simple easy-to-use syntax. This makes Python an excellent language to learn to program for beginners. The environment we are using is called \"notebook\" where we can use a mix of markdown cells (like this one) and code blocks that execute code using a python interpreter.\n","\n","## 0.2 Hello World!\n","\n"," \"Hello, World!\" is a simple program that outputs Hello, World! on the screen.

You just wrote your first program in Python.\n","\n","Breaking it down:\n","\n","\n","1.   `print()` is a function that tells the computer to perform an action. We know it is a function because it uses parentheses. print() tells Python to display or output whatever we put in the parentheses. By default, this will output to the current terminal window.\n","2.   Some functions, like the `print()` function, are built-in functions included in Python by default. These built-in functions are always available for us to use in programs that we create. We can also define our own functions that we construct ourselves through other elements.\n","3. Inside the parentheses of the `print()` function is a sequence of characters — Hello, World! — that is enclosed in quotation marks ' or \". Any characters that are inside of quotation marks are called a string.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"LzD_FmnB-LI1"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Cjd-GtnS-DJv"},"outputs":[],"source":["## write and execute the hello world program in this block"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# 1.

Variables and Constants\n","\n","## 3.1 Python Variables\n","\n","A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. Variable also known as identifier and used to hold value. It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program. Mnemonic variables are recommended to use in many programming languages. A mnemonic variable is a variable name that can be easily remembered and associated. A variable refers to a memory address in which data is stored. For example,\n","\n","```python\n",">>>number = 90\n","```\n","Here, we have created a variable named `number`. We have assigned the value `90` to the variable.\n","\n","You can think of variables as a bag to store books in it and that book can be replaced at any time.\n","\n","```python\n",">>>number = 90\n",">>>number = 9.1\n","```\n","Initially, the value of `number` was `90`. Later, it was changed to `9.1`.\n","\n","**Note:** In Python, we don't actually assign values to the variables. Instead, Python gives the reference of the object(value) to the variable.\n","\n","In Python, we don't need to specify the type of variable because Python is a type infer language and smart enough to get variable type.\n","\n","Python Variable Name Rules\n","\n","1. A variable name must start with a letter A-z or the underscore _ character\n","2. A variable name cannot start with a number 0-9\n","3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )\n","4. Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables). It is recomended to use lowercase letters for variable name.\n","\n","## 3.2 Constants\n","\n","A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information which cannot be changed later.\n","\n","You can think of constants as a bag to store some books which cannot be replaced once placed inside the bag.\n","Assigning value to constant in Python\n","\n","In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned in a module. Here, the module is a new file containing variables, functions, etc which is imported to the main file. Inside the module, constants are written in all capital letters and underscores separating the words.\n","Example 1: Declaring and assigning value to a constant\n","\n","Create a constant.py:\n","\n","```python\n",">>>PI = 3.14\n",">>>GRAVITY = 9.8\n","```\n","Create a main.py:\n","```python\n",">>>import constant\n",">>>print(constant.PI)\n",">>>print(constant.GRAVITY)\n","```\n","```\n","3.14\n","9.8\n","```\n","In the above program, we create a constant.py module file. Then, we assign the constant value to PI and GRAVITY. After that, we create a main.py file and import the constant module. Finally, we print the constant value.\n","\n","**Note:** In reality, we don't use constants in Python.
